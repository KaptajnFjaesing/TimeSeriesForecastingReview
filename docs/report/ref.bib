	capture the statistical relationship between a conditional variable
	$\mathbf{x}$ and a dependent variable $\mathbf{y}$ by modeling their
	conditional probability $p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$. The paper develops best
	practices for conditional density estimation for finance applications with
	neural networks, grounded on mathematical insights and empirical evaluations.
	In particular, we introduce a noise regularization and data normalization
	scheme, alleviating problems with over-fitting, initialization and
	hyper-parameter sensitivity of such estimators. We compare our proposed
	methodology with popular semi- and non-parametric density estimators, underpin
	its effectiveness in various benchmarks on simulated and Euro Stoxx 50 data and
	show its superior performance. Our methodology allows to obtain high-quality
	estimators for statistical expectations of higher moments, quantiles and
	non-linear return transformations, with very little assumptions about the
	return dynamic.},

	abstract = {"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.}

	abstract = {We present an approach for the estimation of probability density functions (pdf) given a set of observations. It is based on the use of feedforward multilayer neural networks with sigmoid hidden units. The particular characteristic of the method is that the output of the network is not a pdf, therefore, the computation of the network's integral is required. When this integral cannot be performed analytically, one is forced to resort to numerical integration techniques. It turns out that this is quite tricky when coupled with subsequent training procedures. Several modifications of the original approach (Modha and Fainman, 1994) are proposed, most of them related to the numerical treatment of the integral and the employment of a preprocessing phase where the network parameters are initialized using supervised training. Experimental results using several test problems indicate that the proposed method is very effective and in most cases superior to the method of Gaussian mixtures.}
