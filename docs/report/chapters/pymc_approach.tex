\chapter{PYMC Approach}

The advantage is that there is complete control over the architecture and the formalism is Bayesian, meaning there is uncertainty and a statistical model behind. The downside is the computation time and the expertise required to get a good model running.

\section{pymc TLP}
The advantage is this is a flexible one-size-fits-all approach, which can accommodate multidimensional time series. The downside is that the computation time and lack of interpretability of the coefficients. Feature engineering is also required to get a good result.


\section{pymc prophet}
The advantage is a flexible model that can accommodate multidimensional time series and no feature engineering is required. The downside is the computation time and difficulty in getting the result to converge. The coefficients are highly interpretable, which is a strength, but this leans into the difficulty of obtaining convergence of a good result.
