\section{Introduction}
Take a benchmark dataset for forecasting and test out different forecasting algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to get light experience with a broad range of algorithms and/or Python packages and their syntax. The algorithms of interest include

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Gaussian Processes (via PyMC),
	\item Bayesian Two-layer perceptron (via PyMC and tensorflow or keras),
	\item Kalman Filter (filterpy?)
	\item Decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, PyMC)
	\item Prohpet,
	\item LSTM (tensorflow or keras?),
	\item SARIMAX (via statsmodels),
	\item Exponential smoothing (via statsmodels)
\end{enumerate}

VS Code with Anaconda will be used. A Git project for each competence development project will be created.
